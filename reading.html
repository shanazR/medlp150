<h1>Reflection: In Plato's Cave From On Photography by Susan Sontag</h1>
<p>
Photography is an essential part of society and everything around us. Everywhere 
you look there is a form of photography or image, intertwined into our daily lives. The 
purpose photography serves is endless with multiple variations and forms. As the world 
has advanced throughout time, so has photography and the way photography is both 
taken and utulized. From the beginning, since photography came to be, it has given us a 
mind of our own. Images and photography is more compelling to our eyes than what we 
acknowledge in reality. We believe images because we can align them with what we 
believe in individually and how we choose to perceive them. The favorbale part of 
photography and imagery is also the fact that it is customizable to each individual. We 
can choose how we perceive an image, but we can also choose how we want to portray an 
image and express our message. Various elements come into play with how we choose to 
express, because with photography there is not limit. Size, color, shape, format, real, 
abstract, etc, the ideas and methods are endless. Photography can be a memory, a feeling, 
an experience, life, achievements, and many more. In today’s world with current events 
and situations, the aspect people have on life now is different and has changed with time. 
With photography evolving, ideas and styles change as well. Personally, photography is a 
symbol of a feeling or memory. When I want to utilize photography or image making, I 
want it to be something that gives me remembrance and a strong feeling, strong passion 
about what it is being portrayed. In today’s world I would want to showcase a sense of 
unity and appreciation. Color, different elements describing differences, but equality. 
Appreciation because the world is divided, yet still a string of connection amongst 
everyone. It would be colorful, with a ray of brightness demonstrating potential for what 
we have, what the world has. Anyone can take any message from one image, one form of 
expression. Social media is such a crucial part of today’s world and this comes into play 
with social media because its platforms showcasing a side of reality that manipulates. 
What is being shared is chosen, not always realistic. Photography teaches us as 
mentioned in the reading, we obtain information because photography and imagery were 
the sources for us to look back on. Influencing ideas as well as touching emotions. What 
we see is what we feel, so with that idea our feelings can get triggered in various ways. 
Control and authorization has been essential with photography, the context behind a 
picture can vary and taken in so many ways, making it a fork of control. Instigating an 
“asthetic” with trends and the desire to find satisfactory approval. Photography itself is in 
it’s own world, fitting into all these categories of expression, symbolism, realism, and 
imagery. The impact and authority photography holds and how that allows us as people to 
live in an imaginary world. We let that control over us because we choose to vividly see 
through images and what is being shown to us. We are both connected but also 
“distanced” from reality with photography and images, the direct placement it has in our 
lives and creative minds.</p>
