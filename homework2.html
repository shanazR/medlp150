  <h3><u>Reflection</u></h3>
<p>
  Taking pictures with these DSL cameras was fun, there was a lot of ways to take the images. Zooming in and out, focusing on objects and going around the building to take pictures of onjects. I saw the colors differ as I took each picture as well as the focus of each object differ. Trying to get on photoshop was diffcult as well as trying to navigate through it, but the editing of the pictures was more convenient as well as playing around with the images. I chose those images in particular because I wanted to utiilize something colorful and and object that had focus. That could also be writing. I messed around with the layers of it trying to make the image stand out and deepen it's shaodws. I feel like the image pops up more when there is a deeper shadow on the edges and in the background. I wanted the colorful part of the image to pop up as well and with depper shadows, the colors look brighter. I was able to look through the layers because there’s so much you can do, and there were options for colors like black, blue, green, and red, which helps adjust the tone vibrantly. I think it was a fun project, but also hard because using photoshop can be confusing as well accessing it. I think linking everything as well can be overwhelming, but once it comes together it looks nice. I wish the images I took were more clear and less blurry, but that also can be adjusted with brightness.
